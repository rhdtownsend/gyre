Polytropic Models
=================

Setting the :nml_n:`model_type` parameter of the :nml_g:`model`
namelist group to :nml_v:`'POLY'` tells the frontend to read the
equilibrium stellar model from a POLY file created by the
:program:`build_poly` tool. See the :ref:`comp-ptrope` and
:ref:`build-poly` appendices for further details.
