Composite Polytropes
********************

Composite polytropes are an extension of standard :wiki:`polytrope
<Polytrope>` models for stellar structure, to allow for
discontinuities in the density :math:`\rho` and/or the polytropic
index :math:`n`.  This appendix lays out the mathematical formalism\
[#formalism]_ underpinning them, as implemented in the
:ref:`build_poly tool <support-tools-build-poly>`.

.. [#formalism] The formalism here is based on `Mixed polytrope with density
    discontinuities` (Christensen-Dalsgaard, 2015, unpublished),
    with extensions to allow for constant-density regions.
