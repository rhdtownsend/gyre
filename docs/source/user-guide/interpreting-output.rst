Interpreting Output Files
*************************

This chapter demonstrates using `Python <https://www.python.org>`__ to
read and plot the summary and detail output files written by the GYRE
:ref:`frontends <frontends>`. Further information about these files is
provided in the :ref:`output-files` chapter.

PyGYRE
======

:git:`PyGYRE <rhdtownsend/pygyre>` is a Python package maintained
separately from GYRE, that provides a set of routines that greatly
simplify the analysis of summary and detail files. Detailed
information about PyGYRE can be found in the `full documentation
<https://pygyre.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__; here, we demonstrate
how to use it to read and plot the output files from the
:ref:`walkthrough` section.

As a preliminary step, you'll need to install PyGYRE from the `Python
Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/>`__. This can be done using
the :command:`pip` command,

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install pygyre

If PyGYRE is already installed, you can upgrade to a more-recent
version via

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install --upgrade pygyre

Analyzing a Summary File
========================

To analyze the summary file written by :program:`gyre` during the
:ref:`example walkthrough <walkthrough>`, change into your :ref:`work
directory <walkthrough-work>` and fire up your preferred interactive
Python environment (e.g., `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`__). Import
PyGYRE and the other modules needed for plotting:

.. code-block:: python

  # Import modules

  import pygyre as pg
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import numpy as np

(you may want to directly cut and paste this code). Next, read the
summary file into the variable `s`:

.. code-block:: python

   # Read data from a gyre summary file

   s = pg.read_output('summary.h5')

The :external:py:func:`pygyre.read_output` function is able to read
files in both :ref:`TXT and HDF formats <file-formats>`, returning the data in an
:external:py:class:`astropy.table.Table` object. To inspect the data
on-screen, simply evaluate the table:

.. code-block:: python

   # Inspect the data

   s

From this, you'll see that there are three columns in the table,
containing the harmonic degree ``l``, radial order ``n_pg`` and
frequency ``freq`` of each mode found during the GYRE run.

Next, plot the frequencies against radial orders via

.. code-block:: python

   # Plot the data

   plt.figure()

   plt.plot(s['n_pg'], s['freq'].real)

   plt.xlabel('n_pg')
   plt.ylabel('Frequency (cyc/day)')

(the values in the ``freq`` column are complex, and we plot the real
part). The plot should look something like :numref:`fig-freq`.

.. _fig-freq:

.. figure:: interpreting-output/fig_freq.svg
   :alt: Plot showing mode frequency versus radial order
   :align: center

   The frequency :math:`\nu` of :math:`\ell=1` and :math:`\ell=2`
   modes, plotted against their radial order :math:`\numpg`.
   (:download:`Source <interpreting-output/fig_freq.py>`)

The straight line connecting the two curves occurs because we are
plotting both the dipole and quadrupole modes together. To separate
them, the table rows can be grouped by harmonic degree:

.. code-block:: python

   # Plot the data, grouped by harmonic degree

   plt.figure()

   sg = s.group_by('l')

   plt.plot(sg.groups[0]['n_pg'], sg.groups[0]['freq'].real, label=r'l=1')
   plt.plot(sg.groups[1]['n_pg'], sg.groups[1]['freq'].real, label=r'l=2')

   plt.xlabel('n_pg')
   plt.ylabel('Frequency (cyc/day)')

   plt.legend()

The resulting plot, in :numref:`fig-freq-grouped`, looks much better.

.. _fig-freq-grouped:

.. figure:: interpreting-output/fig_freq_grouped.svg
   :alt: Plot showing mode frequency versus radial order
   :align: center

   The frequency `\nu` of :math:`\ell=1` and :math:`\ell=2`
   modes, grouped by :math:`\ell` and plotted against their radial order :math:`\numpg`.
   (:download:`Source <interpreting-output/fig_freq_grouped.py>`)

Analyzing a Detail File
=======================

Now let's take a look at one of the detail files, for the mode with
:math:`\ell=1` and :math:`\numpg=-7`. As with the summary file,
:external:py:func:`pygyre.read_output` can be used to read the file
data into an :external:py:class:`astropy.table.Table` object:

.. code-block:: python

   # Read data from a GYRE detail file

   d = pg.read_output('detail.l1.n-7.h5')

Inspecting the data using

.. code-block:: python

   # Inspect the data

   d

shows there are 7 columns: the fractional radius ``x``, the radial
displacement eigenfunction ``xi_r``, the horizontal displacement
eigenfunction ``xi_h``, and 4 further columns storing structure
coefficients (see the :ref:`detail-files` section for descriptions of
these data). Plot the two eigenfunctions using the code

.. code-block:: python

   # Plot displacement eigenfunctions

   plt.figure()

   plt.plot(d['x'], d['xi_r'].real, label='xi_r')
   plt.plot(d['x'], d['xi_h'].real, label='xi_h')

   plt.xlabel('x')

   plt.legend()

.. _fig-disp-eigfunc:

.. figure:: interpreting-output/fig_disp_eigfunc.svg
   :alt: Plot showing displacement eigenfunctions versus fractional radius
   :align: center

   The radial (:math:`\txir`) and horizontal (:math:`\txih`)
   displacement eigenfunctions of the :math:`\ell=1`, :math:`n_{\rm
   pg}=-7` mode, plotted against the fractional radius :math:`x`.
   (:download:`Source <interpreting-output/fig_disp_eigfunc.py>`)

The plot should look something like :numref:`fig-disp-eigfunc`. From
this figure , we see that the radial wavelengths of the eigenfunctions
become very short around a fractional radius :math:`x \approx
0.125`. To figure out why this is, we can take a look at the star's
propagation diagram:

.. code-block:: python

   # Evaluate dimensionless characteristic frequencies

   l = d.meta['l']
   omega = d.meta['omega']

   x = d['x']
   V = d['V_2']*d['x']**2
   As = d['As']
   c_1 = d['c_1']
   Gamma_1 = d['Gamma_1']

   d['N2'] = d['As']/d['c_1']
   d['Sl2'] = l*(l+1)*Gamma_1/(V*c_1)

   # Plot the propagation diagram

   plt.figure()

   plt.plot(d['x'], d['N2'], label='N^2')
   plt.plot(d['x'], d['Sl2'], label='S_l^2')

   plt.axhline(omega.real**2, dashes=(4,2))

   plt.xlabel('x')
   plt.ylabel('omega^2')

   plt.ylim(5e-2, 5e2)
   plt.yscale('log')

Note how we access the mode harmonic degree ``l`` and dimensionless
eigenfrequency ``omega`` through the table metadata dict
``d.meta``. The resulting plot (:numref:`fig-prop-diag`) reveals
that the Brunt-Väisälä frequency squared is large around :math:`x
\approx 0.125`; this feature is a consequence of the molecular weight
gradient zone outside the star's convective core, and results in the
short radial wavelengths seen there in :numref:`fig-disp-eigfunc`.

.. _fig-prop-diag:

.. figure:: interpreting-output/fig_prop_diag.svg
   :alt: Plot showing propagation diagram
   :align: center

   Propagation diagram for the :math:`5\,\Msun` model, plotting the
   squares of the Brunt-Väisälä (:math:`N^{2}`) and Lamb
   (:math:`S_{\ell}^{2}`) frequencies versus fractional radius
   :math:`x`. The horizontal dashed line shows the frequency squared
   :math:`\omega^{2}` of the :math:`\ell=1`, :math:`n_{\rm pg}=-7`
   mode shown in :numref:`fig-disp-eigfunc`. Regions where
   :math:`\omega^{2}` is smaller (greater) than both :math:`N^{2}` and
   :math:`S_{\ell}^{2}` are gravity (acoustic) propagation regions;
   other regions are evanescent. (:download:`Source
