Numerical Methods
*****************

This chapter explains the numerical methods used by the
:program:`gyre` frontend to solve the oscillation equations (similar
approaches are followed in other :ref:`frontends
<frontends>`). Although it aims to be user-friendly, :program:`gyre`
is nevertheless a complex piece of software; thus, getting it to
produce the 'best' results requires some degree of insight into the
algorithms it uses to calculate mode eigenfrequencies and
eigenfunctions.
