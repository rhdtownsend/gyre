Do you want kernels output from the pulsation code? (N) - can't do that yet
N

If you choose kernels output (should they become available), don't forget to create a directory called "kernels" in your working directory (where you are running this code from)

Convection otpions all have to do with how alpha is parameterized:
1 - alpha is a free parameter, set in gridparameters. This is your only correct option if making a helium core white dwarf. Do not choose 2 or 3. The code may run, but alpha will have little significance.
2 - For DAs, alpha is taken from Tremblay et al. 2015. For DBs (set Mhe in gridparameters >= 2000), alpha is taken from non-linear light curve fitting
3 - alpha is taken from non-linear light curve fitting both for DBs and for DAs.
